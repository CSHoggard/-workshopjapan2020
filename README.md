## Workshop 1 & 2: Geometric Morphometrics and Archaeology
#### Instructor: Dr. Christian Steven Hoggard
#### Location: Online (through Slack/Zoom/GitHub/Twitter)

#### About the workshops

This workshop is designed to provide an introduction into the application and potential of geometric morphometric (GMM) methodologists for archaeologists, researchers and enthusiasts. The first workshop  introduces participants to the mathematical underpinnings of statistical shape and form, before detailing the fundamentals of geometric morphometrics, emphasising its statistical power and converage in comparison to traditional morphometrics. The second workshop will be an R-based introduction to geometric morphometrics through the Momocs package.

#### Software

Software: All data input, manipulation and analyses will be **performed in the R Environment through Momocs**. **_Please ensure R/RStudio and all files are downloaded onto your computer/laptop before or at the beginning of workshop two**. Other digitisation methods including tpsDig2 (https://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/soft-dataacq.html) and GUImorph (https://github.com/GUImorph/GUImorph) will also be showcased.
